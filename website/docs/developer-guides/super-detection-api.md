title: Super Detection API
---

The APIs documented on this page are called "super APIs" because they are authenticated by partner's "super auth token".

## Authentication

All APIs are authenticated by the authentication token in the HTTP request header:

`Authorization: Token XXX`

:::tip
Please contact Obico team to obtain your super auth token.

## Endpoint

- `https://app.obico.io/`. Production endpoint. Please use this endpoint unless instructed by the Obico team differently.
- `https://app-stg.obico.io/`. Staging endpoint. Please don't use unless instructed by the Obico team.

## POST `/ent/partners/api/predict/`

### Request {#request}

This POST request should be sent as `multipart/form-data` format.

#### Query parameters {#query-parameters}

- `printer_id`: A id that can uniquely identify the printer within your system. Max 256 characters.
- `print_id`: A id that can uniquely identify the print within the printer it belongs. Max 256 characters.
- `img`: Snapshot from the webcam for failure detection. In JPEG format.

### Response {#response}

#### Status code: `200`

API request was processed successfully.

#### Body

```
{
  "result": {
    "p": 0,
    "temporal_stats": {
      "ewm_mean": 0,
      "rolling_mean_short": 0,
      "rolling_mean_long": 0,
      "prediction_num": 0,
      "prediction_num_lifetime": 0
    }
  }
}
```

- `p`: A number between 0 and 1.0. 0 means no failure is detected. 1 means the maximum confidence on predicting a print failure.
- `temporal_stats`: The temporal stats that may be useful in determining if a failure has actually occurred. These stats are important for smoothening the noises in failure detection. See the tip below for details.
    - `ewm_mean`: Exponentially weighted mean for `p`. EWM window span = 12.
    - `rolling_mean_short`: Short-term rolling mean for `p`. Rolling window span = 310. This rolling mean is reset to 0 when a new print starts.
    - `rolling_mean_long`: Long-term rolling mean for `p`. Rolling window span = 7200. This rolling mean is accumulated over the lifetime of the printer.
    - `prediction_num`: The number of predictions for the current print so far.
    - `prediction_num_lifetime`: The number of predictions for the life-time of the printer.

:::tip
It's a good practice to use the temporal stats to smoothen out the noises in failure detection. Otherwise there may be excessive amount of false alarms.

In Obico open-source server, the way these temporal stats are used can be simplistically described as below:


- If `ewm_mean - rolling_mean_long < 0.36`: no failure.
- Else if `ewm_mean - rolling_mean_long > 0.99`: failure.
- Else if `ewm_mean - rolling_mean_long > 0.78`: maybe failure.
- Else if `ewm_mean > (rolling_mean_short - rolling_mean_long) * 3.8`: maybe failure.

:::

:::tip
All these "magic numbers", such as the rolling window sizes, or thresholds such as 0.36 or 0.78, should be considered as hyper-parameters. You are highly recommended to go through the hyper-parameters tuning process to find the optimal values for them.
