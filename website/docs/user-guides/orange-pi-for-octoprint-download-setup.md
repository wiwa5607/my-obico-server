The Orange Pi for OctoPrint SD card images are built and maintained by the Obico team, and supported by the Obico community. Please come to [our discord server](https://obico.io/discord/) in case you run into any issues with it.
:::

Orange Pi has become a popular choice to run OctoPrint, especially nowadays it's harder to buy a Raspberry Pi at a reasonable price than to make your in-laws happy. However, many steps and familiarity with Linux commands were required to run OctoPrint on an Orange Pi.

Until now. [The Obico team](https://obico.io/) has decided to take stab at this problem by figuring all it takes to build an image that you can just download and flash to an SD card to get OctoPrint up and running. This makes it just as easy to run OctoPrint on an Orange Pi as it's on a Raspberry Pi.

## Hardwares required {#hardwares-required}

- An Orange Pi board. You can source the board from [Orange Pi's official website](http://www.orangepi.org/) yourself. If you are located in North America, you can also buy [an Orange Pi kit from us](https://store.obico.io/collections/orange-pi-for-octoprint), which will come with 1-year Obico Pro plan as well as warranty and technical support from the Obico team.
- A high quality SD card (class 10 or better) with at least 8GB of storage
- An Ethernet cable
- USB cable to connect your 3D printer to the Orange Pi (comes with most printers)

:::caution
Currently only Orange Pi 3 LTS (recommended) and Orange Pi Zero 2, the 2 most-used boards, are supported. If you have a different board and you want us to build an image for it, please make suggestions in [our discord server](https://obico.io/discord/).

- Locate the file that you previously downloaded and unzipped and select it.

- Insert your SD card into the computer.

:::tip
Use a high-quality, class 10 or better SD card with at least 8GB of storage. If you plan on creating a lot of time-lapses, more storage is recommended.
:::

![](/img/user-guides/octoprint-orange-pi-zero-2-kit/select-sd-card.png)

- Select the SD card

:::note
The SD card will be wiped, so be sure there are no important files on the card.
:::

- Click Write:

![](/img/user-guides/octoprint-orange-pi-zero-2-kit/rpi-imager-warning.png)

- Confirm that you are aware the SD card will be erased. You may be asked to enter your administrator password for your computer as well.

:::tip
The file is large, so it may take a while (up to 40 minutes but likely less) for the software to be installed on the SD card. Grab a coffee, and get the rest of the kit setup while the software is installed on the SD card.
:::

## Connect to OctoPrint {#connect-to-octoprint}

## Useful tips (not required by highly recommended) {#useful-tips-not-required-by-highly-recommended}

### Install the heat sink {#install-the-heat-sink}

It's almost always a good idea to install the heat sink on SBCs so that they won't overheat easily. If you bought [an Orange Pi kit from us](https://store.obico.io/collections/orange-pi-for-octoprint), the heat sink will be included.

### Put the Orange Pi in a case {#put-the-orange-pi-in-a-case}

While putting your Orange Pi is not required, it is recommended to help keep it clean and safe.

We don't recommend to use the official Orange Pi case, due to its pour cooling capabilities. You can [print the case we designed](https://www.printables.com/model/322614-orange-pi-zero-2-case). If you prefer a different case, we also made a [collection on Printables](https://www.printables.com/social/288649-obico/collections/346815) with a few other options that have been tested.

### Connect a Camera {#connect-a-camera}

You can mount your camera in many different ways depending on your printer. The best mounting solution depends on how you plan to use the camera with your 3D printer.

For example, If you are simply interested in casually monitoring your 3D prints with a camera, you don't have to consider any extra factors. Simply position your camera any way you like. If you are planning to use your webcam to record timelapse videos or take advantage of Obico's Ai failure detection, you may want to consider the angle of the camera further, it's focus and the lighting conditions. Here are a couple of options for mounting your camera:

![](/img/user-guides/octoprint-orange-pi-zero-2-kit/octoprint-camera-mount-1.jpg)

- Print a mount: 3D printing a mount is a great option. Here are a few mounts tested to work with the camera included with the kit.

![](/img/user-guides/octoprint-orange-pi-zero-2-kit/octoprint-camera-mount-3.png)

- Use a box, cup, or another surface to elevate the camera. Even a box can provide a nice camera view.

### Configure Wifi {#configure-wifi}

Once the Raspberry Pi Imager has finished flashing the OctoPrint software to your SD card, you can remove it from your computer and insert it into the Orange Pi.

#### 1. Connect the Orange Pi to your router. {#1-connect-the-orange-pi-to-your-router}

We will assume most users will be connecting via Wifi although connection via ethernet is recommended whenever possible.

- Connect one end of an ethernet cable to the Orange Pi, and connect the other end to a port on your wireless router. Assuming you will connect to wifi, this is only temporary, so do not worry if this is not where you plan to keep the device.
- Connect the included power supply to the Orange Pi and plug it into an electrical outlet.

#### 2. Find the Pi's Ip Address {#2-find-the-pis-ip-address}

- Now, you will need to find the IP address of your Orange Pi. This can be done in multiple ways. The easiest way is to connect to your router's admin portal.

:::tip
If you have an internet provider such as Verizon or Xfinity, instructions for connecting are on the router. In this example, I will access the Verizon wireless router settings by entering the admin username and password found on my router at mynetworksettings.com. The admin username and passwords are often different from the wifi username and password.
:::

![](/img/user-guides/octoprint-orange-pi-zero-2-kit/wifi-router-1.png)

- Under Devices, find the device named orangepizero2. For Verizon routers, the IP address can be found by clicking the gear icon for a particular device.

![](/img/user-guides/octoprint-orange-pi-zero-2-kit/ip-address-router.png)

- You are looking for the IPv4 Address. Once you have found it, write it down or copy and paste it into your notes for easy reference.

If you are having trouble finding the IP address for your Orange Pi, there are a few other ways to find it.

- For Windows users, download Angry IP Scanner, a free software, and use it to scan for IP addresses. You are looking for the one that says _orangepizero2_

- Mac users can follow a similar process by downloading Lan Scan, a free IP scanner for mac.

:::tip
If you are not planning to configure wifi, you can skip the rest of this section and go to the **Connecting to OctoPrint** section.
:::

#### 3. SSH into Your Orange Pi {#3-ssh-into-your-orange-pi}

![](/img/user-guides/octoprint-orange-pi-zero-2-kit/ssh-orange-pi.png)

- Now, open a terminal window. For Mac users, Terminal can be found in your applications Windows users will find the Command Prompt in programs.

- SSH into your Orange Pi. SSH is a secure way to access network services securely over an unsecured network. Type the following command:

```
ssh pi@your-ip-address
```

- Enter the password. The password is **orangepi.** You will not see the letters as you type the password, but they are still being entered.

![](/img/user-guides/octoprint-orange-pi-zero-2-kit/orange-pi-zero-2-welcome.png)

- Hit enter to confirm the password. You will then be greeted with the _Opi Zero2_ logo confirming you are logged in.

#### 4. Connect to your wireless network {#4-connect-to-your-wireless-network}

![](/img/user-guides/octoprint-orange-pi-zero-2-kit/nmtui-connect-wifi.png)

- Enter the following command to open up the network configuration menu. You can simply copy and paste the command into the terminal and then hit enter on your keyboard to execute the command.

```
nmtui
```

![](/img/user-guides/octoprint-orange-pi-zero-2-kit/edit-connection-nmtui.png)

![](/img/user-guides/octoprint-orange-pi-zero-2-kit/activate-connection-nmtui.png)

- Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to highlight _Activate a connection_ and then use the cursor to highlight _OK_ and click enter.

![](/img/user-guides/octoprint-orange-pi-zero-2-kit/activate-wifi.png)

- Use the arrow keys again to highlight your wifi address name, and then hit enter on your keyboard.
- Enter the password for your wifi as it appears on your router. Hit enter to confirm.

![](/img/user-guides/octoprint-orange-pi-zero-2-kit/wifi-activated.png)

- You can verify your wifi has been connected successfully when the upper right indicator switches from \<activate\> to \<deactivate\>. Once confirmed, move the arrow key to back and hit enter.

#### 5. Find your Wireless IP address {#5-find-your-wireless-ip-address}

![](/img/user-guides/octoprint-orange-pi-zero-2-kit/find-wlan.png)

- Next, lets get the wireless ip address that was assigned to your orangepi. Enter the following command and hit enter.

```
sudo ifconfig -a
```

- In the output, find the line that starts with _wlan0:_ and note the IP address next to _inet._ Write it down or store it in your notes for easy reference.
